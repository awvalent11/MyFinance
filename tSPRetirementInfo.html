        <h2> What is TSP?</h2><br /> 
        <p>TSP stands for Thrifty Savings Program. It is a Federal Government-sponsored retirement savings and investment program. 
        It offers the same type of savings and tax benefits that many private corporations offer thier employees under "401(k)" plans.

        <h2>Blended Retirement System</h2> <br /> 
        <p>If you are a service member of the uniformed services who began servign on or after January 1, 2018, your 
            service automatically enrolled you in the TSP (or will) once you have served 60 days and 3% of your basic pay is deducted
            from your paycheck each pay period and deposited in the traditional balance of your TSP account.
